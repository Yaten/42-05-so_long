# SoLong

This project is a very small 2D game, with very basic gameplay elements. We use the [minilibx-linux](https://github.com/42Paris/minilibx-linux) and X11 graphic server.
## Gameplay
The player has to dodge enemies and collect all bonuses to escape. The map (`.ber`) is loaded as an argument in the execution of the program.

> So long, and thanks for all the fish!
